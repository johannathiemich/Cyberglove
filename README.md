# Cyberglove

Practical course "Virtual Reality" in the Winter semester 2017/18 at the Karlsruhe Insitute of Technology. 
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufuSgNBOhbE) shows an overview over what we achieved during this project.

Our task was to continue developing an already existing Cyberglove by adding new use case examples, developing a new circuit board and case for that. In the end, we ordered the 
board and 3d-printed the case. The case was attached using a magnet.

In the file cyberglove.pdf we documented in detail what we worked on during this practical course.

Please note: The github repo description lists C++ as the used language, but we implemented the use cases mainly using Python.
